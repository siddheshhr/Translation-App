1. Speech-to-Text (STT)
The Speech-to-Text feature allows users to convert their spoken words into text.
It uses the Speech Recognition library to capture audio from the user's microphone and transcribes the speech into readable text on the screen.
Users can utilize this functionality to take notes, transcribe conversations, or dictate texts.

2. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
The Text-to-Speech feature enables users to convert written text into speech.
Users can enter any text in the provided text area, choose a preferred language from the drop-down menu, and then click the "Text to Speech" button.
The app will generate an audio output of the text, allowing users to listen to the content in the selected language.

3. Language Translation
The app also offers a language translation feature using the translate library.
Users can input text in one language and select their desired target language from the drop-down menu.
Upon clicking the "Translate" button, the app will display the translated text in the chosen language.
